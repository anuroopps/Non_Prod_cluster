OCP provides an internal, integrated container image registry that can be deployed in your OpenShift Container Platform environment to locally manage images.

The Image Registry Operator runs in the openshift-image-registry namespace, and manages the registry instance in that location.

The Operator is defined by the

configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io Custom Resource Definition (CRD).


If you need to automatically enable the Image Registry default route, patch the Image Registry Operator CRD.

Procedure :-
-------------

Patch the Image Registry Operator CRD using following command

oc patch configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io/cluster --type merge -p '{"spec":{"defaultRoute":true}}'


Configuring additional trust stores for image registry access :-
----------------------------------------------------------------

The image.config.openshift.io/cluster custom resource can contain a reference to a config map that contains additional certificate authorities to be trusted during image registry access.

Prerequisites
---------------

The certificate authorities (CA) must be PEM-encoded.













 Configuring registry storage :-
-------------------------------

oc edit configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io/cluster


add the following data,

storage:
  s3:
    bucket: <bucket-name>
    region: <region-name>

sample Ex :-

s3:
      bucket: dbp-nonprod
      region: IN
      regionEndpoint: https://dbp-nonprod.dbp.hcpdr.obc.co.in
